### A Personal Digital Assistant designed to run on either an ESP32 or RP2040

This is a work in progress and is therefore not finished.

Inspired by: https://github.com/ashtf8/EinkPDA

## [Project Summary]
This is still a new project, and as I don't have any of the parts yet, I am focused on writing some base-line code for navigating in a filesystem and editing text files.

The plan for the project is to design a pocket device powered by either an ESP32 or RP2040 chip on a custom PCB with keyboard and screen. The screen is expected to be an E-ink display to allow for lower battery usage.
The device should be able to assist its user in everyday tasks such as note-taking, todo and organizing plans.

## [TO-DO]
- Text (.txt) editor/note app
- Todo list app
- Journaling app
- Calendar app
